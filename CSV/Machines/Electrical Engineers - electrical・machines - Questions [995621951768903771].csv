In synchronous machine, MMF generated by rotor is mostly consumed by airgap, Since airgap has very high reluctance.

The linear part of the relationship is because, at small value of field current the whole MMF is required by the air gap to create magnetic flux but as the value of MMF exceeds some certain value, the flux in iron parts get saturated and hence the relationship between the flux and field current no longer remain linear. Now assume that if there were no saturation (assuming no iron part is present rather only air gap is present), the relationship between the field current and no load voltage would have been a straight line and that is why the straight line OCC is called Air Gap Line.

**What is air-gap?**
It is physical gap between rotor and stator, Since this gap is filled with air, It is called Air-gap.

**Comparing Magnetic circuit to electric circuit.**
Flux -  Current 
Magneto motive force or MMF  -  Voltage
Reluctance - Resistance 

**What is reluctance?**
It is resistance to offered to magnetic flux. Iron has very less reluctance, while air has very high reluctance towards flux.","",""

**Wattmeter terminals and their meaning.**

Wattmeter is used to measure power, Since power is **V x I** we need both current and voltage to get power, Thus a inside a wattmeter there are 2 coils **Current coil**, **Voltage coil**(A.K.A. Pressure coil). 

Since current is measured in series and voltage in parallel, You can now see the why wattmeter diagram is the way it is.

*Current coil terminals*

` M ` - connected to **Mains** hence M.

` L ` - connected to **Load** hence **L**.

*Voltage coil terminals*

` C ` -  connected current current coil, Or Mains.  

` V ` - connected to another phase. (Say if `M` is connected in R-phase `V` is connected to Y-phase)","",""

**Why field rheostat should be in minimum position at starting and stopping of the machine?**

` Short answer `

To limit starting current in armature.

` Long answer `
If field rheostat is min. position, Resistance offered to field current is less, so more current will flow in field coil, Since current is directly proportion to magnetic flux, field coil will produce a high flux.

This high field flux will cut the armature winding and induce, an *EMF* (BACK E.M.F.) which will oppose the armature current. So current in armature is reduced.

If we do not place Field rheostat in minimum position say we place at max position during starting, This causes little current flow through field coil, and very large current flow through armature coil due loss of back emf at starting. This leads to damage the armature coil.","",""
