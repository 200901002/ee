**What is back EMF in synchronous motor?**

Voltage is generated in the stator winding by the synchronously-revolving field of the rotor This generated EMF is known as back e.m.f. and opposes the stator voltage. The magnitude of Eb depends upon rotor speed and rotor flux  per pole. Since rotor speed is constant; the value of Eb depends upon the rotor flux per pole i.e. exciting rotor current If.","",""
