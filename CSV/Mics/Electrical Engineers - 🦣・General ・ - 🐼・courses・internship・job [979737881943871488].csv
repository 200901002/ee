There are many, many roles and it is highly recommended that everyone update their LinkedIn Profile to get some internships that you might be interested in. Here are some job roles and there are so many more available abroad. Optimize your profile so that recruiters reach out to you, do some certifications (preferably CS-sided because afaik, most recruiters tend to look for good CSE certifications and will give you an advantage over other candidates, I dunno any EEE certifications, sorry) and do some projects to make sure your profile stands out.

Here are some job positions in EEE available in Chennai.

Good luck y'all! College is ending soon! (Only one year because 4th year won't be much I think, correct me if I am wrong. Mostly projkect work only.)","",""

Link for both- 

CS50P:- https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/
CS50X:- https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

This one's from Georgia Tech for Python as well.
