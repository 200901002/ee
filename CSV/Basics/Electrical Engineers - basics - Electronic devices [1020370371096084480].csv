` Thyratron `

Derived from ancient Greek *Thyra* - *Door*

Thyratron is a gas-filled tube used as a high-power electrical switch.

` Thyristor `

This word is a combination of **Thyratron** + **Transistor**.

` What is meant by high input impedance? `

High impedance means that a point in a circuit (a node) allows a relatively small amount of current through, per unit of applied voltage at that point.

` Why an op amp should have high input impedance? `

- Because they are voltage-gain (devices that amplify voltages). In order to drop **entire voltage across the input**, the impedance has to be very high, as ohm's law states, V=IR.

- It's also important to prevent the loading effect. If the impedance were **small**, the current draw would be **high** which loads the source.

**Why ω is 2πf?**
