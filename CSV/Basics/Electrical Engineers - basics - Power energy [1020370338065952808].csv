**Electrical interview questions**

` Why reactive power needs to be compensated? `

Electrical energy generated by AC source is stored in capacitor or inductor in first quarter of cycle, In the next quarter of cycle the power is returned to source, So to avoid oscillation of power which will result in losses in transmission line we need to compensate for reactive power.

` What are harmonics? `

Unwanted waveforms that gets introduced in the fundamental waveform of voltage or current.

` How it is created? `

**In machines**

- Space harmonics fluxes are produced by the windings, slotting, magnetic saturation, inequalities in the air gap length. 

- These harmonic fluxes induce voltages and circulate harmonic currents in the rotor windings. The interaction between the harmonic currents generated in the rotor and the harmonic fluxes results in the Harmonic torques, vibrations and the noise.

**In power systems**

- Electronic equipment with nonlinear loads drawing in current in **abrupt** short pulses(like UPS and SMPS which is used in every computer). The short pulses cause distorted current waveforms, which in turn cause harmonic currents to flow back into other parts of the power system.","",""

Because even harmonics cancel out over a half cycle.

` Why don't we talk about 115th or 1501th harmonics? `

Because they will have very less amplitude, which will not affect original waveform that much, But 3rd, 5th, or 7th harmonic will have significant value which when not considered will distort the waveform and may cause malfunctioning of the load.","",""
