```Must know```

**Op-Amp** Golden Rules

When an OP-amp is configured in any **negative-feedback** arrangement, It will obey the following rules:

1.  The inputs to the op-amp draw no-current(true whether negative feedback or not)

2. The OP-amp output will do whatever it can(within its limitations) to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.
